    {
      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Create public routes directory structure",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of creating a public routes directory structure in an Express.js application, including file creation, router setup, and integration with the main application",
      "reasoning": "This is a relatively straightforward task involving directory creation and basic Express.js router setup. The complexity is low as it's primarily structural work with no complex logic, but it does require understanding the application's architecture to properly integrate the new router."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement embed retrieval endpoint",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps to implement a GET endpoint for retrieving embed configurations using Prisma, including route definition, database query implementation, response formatting, and error handling",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a route handler with database interaction using Prisma. While not highly complex, it requires understanding the database model, implementing proper error handling, and ensuring the endpoint works correctly without authentication middleware."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Implement data sanitization",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of creating a data sanitization utility for ChatEmbed objects, including identifying sensitive fields, implementing a whitelist approach, testing with various data scenarios, and integrating with the API endpoint",
      "reasoning": "This task requires careful consideration of security implications. The developer needs to identify all sensitive fields, implement a robust sanitization strategy, and ensure no sensitive data leaks. The whitelist approach adds complexity but is more secure."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Add input validation",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps to implement input validation for the embedId parameter, including selecting a validation library, defining validation rules, creating reusable middleware, and implementing error responses",
      "reasoning": "Input validation is moderately complex, requiring selection and implementation of a validation library, defining appropriate validation rules, and creating error handling. The reusable middleware aspect adds some complexity but will benefit the project long-term."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Configure rate limiting",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of implementing rate limiting for a public API endpoint, including middleware selection, configuration for different environments, header implementation, and considerations for distributed systems",
      "reasoning": "Rate limiting involves moderate complexity due to the need to configure appropriate limits, implement proper headers, and potentially address distributed system concerns. The task requires understanding of HTTP headers and API best practices."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Set up CORS configuration",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps to implement CORS for a public API endpoint, including middleware configuration, origin policy decisions, header setup, and creating a flexible configuration system",
      "reasoning": "CORS configuration is moderately complex, requiring understanding of cross-origin security concepts and proper header implementation. The configurable aspect adds complexity as it needs to be flexible enough to update without code changes."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement access logging",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of implementing access logging for an API endpoint, including middleware creation, determining what data to log, privacy considerations, and integration with existing logging systems",
      "reasoning": "This task is relatively straightforward, involving middleware creation and integration with existing logging systems. The main considerations are determining what data to log and ensuring privacy compliance, but the overall implementation is not highly complex."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Add HTTP caching headers",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps to implement HTTP caching for an API endpoint, including appropriate header selection, cache duration strategy, ETag implementation, and handling conditional requests",
      "reasoning": "HTTP caching involves moderate complexity due to the need to understand various caching headers, implement ETags or Last-Modified mechanisms, and handle conditional requests. Determining appropriate cache durations also requires careful consideration of the application's data update patterns."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement comprehensive error handling",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of implementing comprehensive error handling for a public API endpoint, including error scenario identification, response format standardization, security considerations, and integration with existing error handling systems",
      "reasoning": "This task has higher complexity as it requires handling multiple error scenarios, creating a consistent error format, and balancing informative messages with security concerns. It also depends on other tasks and needs to integrate with their implementations."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Document the API endpoint",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps to document a new API endpoint, including updating API specifications, creating usage examples, documenting error responses, explaining rate limiting and caching behavior, and integrating with existing documentation systems",
      "reasoning": "Documentation is moderately complex due to the need to comprehensively cover all aspects of the endpoint including parameters, responses, errors, and special behaviors. It depends on many other tasks being completed first to ensure accuracy."
